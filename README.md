`{brickapp}` is a Shiny application that provides statistical summaries,
visualizations, and predictions based on the LEGO inventory metadata
originating from the [rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/home/) LEGO
parts portal. Throughout the [Shiny in Production: Tools and
Techniques](https://posit-conf-2023.github.io/shiny-r-prod/) workshop at
[posit::conf(2023)](https://posit.co/conference/), the workshop
participants will practice enhancing this application for use in a
production setting.

## Workshop Instructions

The project used for this particular exercise / demonstration is hosted
on [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud) in this
[space](https://posit.cloud/spaces/400774/join?access_code=DDgV_peF5WCCCpB5JHjQtMN2aHByWoNF0k5p8Wp7).

After opening the project, perform the following steps to set up the R
environment:

1.  In the R console, the `{renv}` package will begin to bootstrap
    itself into the package library. You will likely see a message
    indicating one or more packages in the lockfile are not installed.
    In the R console, run the following command to restore the complete
    package library: `renv::restore(prompt = FALSE)` .
2.  In the **Git** tab of the RStudio IDE panel, select the
    **performance-exercise1** branch to load the files associated with
    this particular exercise / demonstration
